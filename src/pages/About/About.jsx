        <strong> About Cold Truth Culture</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the beginning of time, every culture from all around of the world
        has appreciated and dedicated time to creating and collecting meaningful
        works of art. Until now, there have been a number of barriers holding
        artists back from sharing, exchanging, and getting recognition for their
        artwork all around the globe. Limited means to increase exposure for
        artist's work can prevent collectors and enthusiasts from ever seeing,
        purchasing, or admiring such art. There are thousands of incredibly
        talented artists from 2nd and 3rd world countries who may never get the
        chance to share their craft despite the decades of experience they have.
        These artists may lack the initial capital and education required to set
        up an online store in order to begin to sell and market their own work.
        Even seemingly small purchases from 1st world countries could go a long
        way for these artist's families and wellbeing. Another barrier is the
        difficulty for the unbanked population to acquire cryptocurrency without
        access to financial services or KYC requirements. Without having an
        issued means of Identification in some countries, it may be impossible
        to get started with cryptocurrency in order to get equal opportunities
        as all of the other NFT artists on the blockchain.

        <strong>This is where Cold Truth Culture steps in...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer the chance for artists of all skill levels to begin their
        journey with digital artwork on the blockchain as well as provide them
        with an incubator of sorts to help kick start their career. CTC artists
        are paid in our native cryptocurrency (COLD) for submitting artwork and
        promoting the artwork in our NFT farms. We provide them with the tools
        and advice to create their very own projects and use our resources to
        get recognition among the community. Some artists have even received
        requests for paid work.

        Pioneers in the early stages of the new digital blockchain age within
        popular media, the Cold Truth Culture NFT community has solidified
        itself within the Unifty NFT environment by creating a decentralised
        autonomous organisation on the xDai chain for the benefit of all
        crypto-artists. The Cold Truth Cash token ($COLD) has attracted many
        experienced artists as well as newcomers into the crypto NFT space from
        all over the world and united them on a mission to spread
        crypto-knowledge to a new generation of artists and enthusiasts. The
        Cold Truth Culture is a major part of this NFT phenomenon by
        simultaneously increasing its value for artists, the consumers, and the
        crypto-world: the only place where this can be possible.
